Todo:
-----

make timeout configurable.

timeout / HZ?

link to device in /sys or export device name.

printk -> dev_info -> iio_dev_info or remove.

update comment / write linux/Documentation/ .. .txt

enum measurement_state

What does (should do) set_trigger_state exactly (how to test this)?
	Power management?

cleanup code: make checkpatch --strict work.

test with 2 sensors.

do not configure in gpiod_get (??)

In progress:
------------

Configure pins and timeout via configfs.
	In progress.

Check how gpiod_get() works (how the pins map to names)
	Must create device tree entry for that. TODO: test this.
	For now use the integer based interface

Done:
-----

Why does rmmod not work?
	Kernel was compiled without rmmod support.
